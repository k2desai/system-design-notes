### Talking Points:

Scaling the database: 
• Vertical scaling vs Horizontal scaling 
• SQL vs NoSQL 
• Master-slave replication 
• Read replicas 
• Consistency models 
• Database sharding 

Other talking points: 
• Keep web tier stateless 
• Cache data as much as you can 
• Support multiple data centers 
• Lose couple components with message queues 
• Monitor key metrics. For instance, QPS during peak hours and latency 


### Open Questions:
1. What is QPS / RPS of a typical server? 64000? - https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-modern-system-design-interview-for-engineers-managers/requirements-of-tinyurls-design
