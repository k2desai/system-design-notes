Always consider the security implications of your API. Never pass in userId or timestamps in the request body or query parameters. This is a red flag as it shows a lack of understanding of security best practices. Remember that you can't trust any data sent from the client as it can be easily manipulated. User data should always be passed in the session or JWT, while timestamps should be generated by the server.
