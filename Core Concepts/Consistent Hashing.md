If we use hash%N for partitioning, it wont work well if servers are added / removed. Instead SHA-1 is used as hash function and the hash space goes from 0 - 2^160-1. We use the same hash function to map servers on the ring (based on IP/server name) as well as the keys. To determine which server a key is stored on, go clockwise from the key until a server is found. Adding / removing server only requires redistribution of a fraction of keys - we need to move anti-clockwise until we find a server to find affected keys. 

To avoid non-uniform key distribution and to keep partitions roughly the same size, we use virtual nodes - servers with higher capacity could be assigned more virtual nodes. As the number of virtual nodes increases, the more balanced the ring becomes. Typically we use 100-200 virtual nodes - we can tune this as per system requirements.

For replication - data can be replicated to the next N nodes on the ring (making sure we only choose unique servers - it is important to replicate data across multiple data centers)

Advantages:
1. Minimized keys redistributed when servers added / removed
2. Easy to scale horizontally because data is more evenly distributed - mitigate hotspot key problem.
