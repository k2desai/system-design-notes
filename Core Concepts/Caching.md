Cache aside

Read Through:
1. The cache checks if the data is available (cache hit).
2. If the data is not in the cache (cache miss), the cache system reads the data from the primary storage.
3. The cache stores the data in the cache.
4. The cache returns the data to the client.
5. Subsequent read requests for the same data will be served directly from the cache until the data expires or is evicted.
