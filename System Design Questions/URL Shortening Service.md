 ### Problem Description
Shortened URLs are convenient to use, facilitate higher degree of sharing, less error-prone while typing and require smaller storage space

### Questions to ask
1. Can you give an example of how it will work?
2. What is the traffic volume 
3. How long is the shortened URL 
4. What characters are allowed in the shortened URL -> Assume 0-9,a-z,A-Z = 62 chars
5. Can shortened URLs be deleted or updated -> for simplicity, assume we cannot?
6. If two users are requesting shortening of same URL, do we want to give back same or different shortened URLs?
7. For how long should we store the mappings?
8. Who has permissions to access generated URLs? Are they public or does user decide access? 

### Functional Requirements
1. Given a long URL, return a much shorter URL
2. Given a short URL, redirect to the long URL 
3. Optionally allow users to select custom short link for their URL 
4. Links expire after a specified time, users can override this expiration value 

### Non Functional Requirements
1. High availability
2. Low latency 
3. Scalability
4. Fault tolerance 
5. Security - shortened links should not be predictable 
6. Gather analytics - web page accessed, country of visitor, date/time of access

### Capacity Estimation
1. 100 million URLs generated / day ~= 1000 writes/sec
2. Assuming read : write = 10:1, ~10000 reads/sec
3. Over 10 years, we need to support 400 billion records. If each record is 100 bytes, storage is 40 TB

### APIs
1. POST api/v1/data/shorten
	1. Request parameter - longUrl, customAlias(optional), expiry(optional)
	2. Return - shortUrl 
2. GET api/v1/shortUrl
	1. Return longUrl for redirection 
3. DELETE api/v1/deleteUrl (check header to get user and only delete if user owns this url)
	1. Request parameter - shortUrl

### Object Model
1. URL mapping table 
2. User details

### Database Choices
1. Use NoSQL because easier to scale? 

### Interesting Algorithms/Approaches
1. Hash + Collision resolution - Use hash functions like CRC32, MD5, SHA-1, take first 7 characters, if hash collision, then recursively append predefined string until no collision. Time consuming. Consider Bloom Filters?
2. Base 62 conversion - [[Unique ID Generator]] and converted to base62, not secure because easy to predict next value, get old values. 
3. Key Generation Service - generates 7-8 letter strings beforehand and stores them in a database. If we have multiple servers, KGS assigns keys to the servers and marks them as used (to avoid same key being given to multiple servers). If server dies before using all keys, it is acceptable since we have a lot of keys, some can be wasted 

### Scaling Challenges
1. Servers are stateless and easy to scale 
2. Database scaling - replication and sharding 
3. Database partitioning:
	1. Range-based - depending on first char of shortUrl - can cause imbalanced partitions
	2. Hash-based - hash of shortUrl - overloaded partitions can be solved using [[Consistent Hashing]]
4. Cache frequently used URLs - LRU caching 

### Deep Dive Topics
1. Redirection:
	1. 301 redirect - permanently moved - reduces server load 
	2. 302 redirect - temporarily moved - can track analytics like click rate 
2. [[Rate Limiter]]
3. Analytics collection
